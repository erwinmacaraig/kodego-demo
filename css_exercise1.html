				<h2>Learning CSS3 selectors - "The basics"

				<p>
					To apply CSS to an element you need to select it. CSS provides you with a number of different ways to do this, and you can explore them in this module.
					<br>
					All HTML tags have styles associated with them.
					<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Using a class selector gives you the ability to setup an independent style that you can then apply to any HTML Tag.
					<br>
					Unlike an HTML selector, which automatically targets a specific tag, a class is given a unique name that is then specified using the sytle attribute in the HTML tag or tags you want to use it in.
					<br>For example:
					<br>
					<span>
						<span>p.authorName</span>

						<span>{</span>
						<span>font-size: 1em;</span>
						<span>}</span>
					</span>
				</p>

					<h3>To define an HTML selector:</h3>
					<p>
						Start with the HTML selector whose properties yiou want to define. Add a curly bracket to open your rule. Make sure you always close your declaration list with a curly bracket.
					</p>

				</section>

				<h2>Learning CSS3 selectors - "Attribute Selectors"</h2>
				<p>
					You can look for elements that have a certain HTML attribute, or have a certain value for an HTML attribute, using the attribute selector.
					<br>
					Instruct CSS to look for attributes by wrapping the selector with square brackets
																																																																																																																																							(<span>[ ]</span>).

					<br>
					<span>
						<span>[ data-type='primary' ]</span>{
						<span>color: blue;
						</span>}
					</span>
					<br>
					This CSS looks for all elements that have an attribute of data-type with a value of primary, like this:
					<br>
					&lt;div data-type="primary"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
				</p>

				<h2>Learning CSS3 selectors - "Action PseudoClass Selectors"</h2>
				<p>
					HTML elements find themselves in various states, either because they are interacted with, or one of their child elements is in a certain state.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, an HTML element could be hovered with the mouse pointer by a user or a child element could also be hovered by the user. For those situations, use the
					<span>:hover</span>
					pseudo-class.

					<h3>
						Pseudo-element #
					</h3>
					Pseudo-elements differ from pseudo-classes because instead of responding to the platform state, they act as if they are inserting a new element with CSS. Pseudo-elements are also syntactically different from pseudo-classes, because instead of using a single colon (<span>:</span>), we use a double colon (<span>::</span>)

				<h2>Learning CSS3 selectors - "Combinators Selectors"</h2>

				<p>
					A combinator is what sits between two selectors. For example, if the selector was p > strong, the combinator is the > character. The selectors which use these combinators help you select items based on their position in the document.

				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>Descendant combinator #</h3>
					To understand descendant combinators, you need to first understand parent and child elements.


				</p>
				<p>
					&lt;p&gt;A paragraph of text with some &lt;/strong&gt; bold text for emphasis&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
				</p>
				<p>
					The parent element is the &lt;p&gt; which contains text. Inside that &lt;p&gt; element is a &lt;strong&gt; element, making its content bold. Because it is inside the &lt;p&gt;, it is a child element.
